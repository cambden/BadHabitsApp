4.0 Implementation Plan <br>
4.1 Delivery Roadmap
Suggested Word Count: 150-250 words
Draft a rough timeline for your delivery plan for the next term. Identify 2-3 key milestones, such as completing API development, and briefly state the acceptance criteria for each milestone. Where possible, link specific epics or user stories from your backlog to each milestone.

Sprint 1 – Initial Thought Processing / Brainstorming<br>
Sprint 2 – Work on Initial Coding to Create a Rough Idea<br>
Milestone 1 – Rough Idea of a Working Habit Tracking App<br>
Sprint 3 – Continue Development of App<br>
Milestone 2 – Finalization of App<br>
Testing – Test App Making sure Everything Runs Perfect<br>
Milestone 3 – Completion and Presentation of App<br>
<br>
For API Development it will be us researching for the most part for the implementation of it in our free time; The API will really speedup our speed between servers on the app giving a better user optimization experience, it will also be very useful for reccomending items to help quit habits in the 'Cart' based on the habit you are trying to quit.
<br>
Overall, for our roadmap everything seems very possible since it it just getting the app done essientially, all these extra task will be long-term goals such as the cart, leaderboard, and further on.



4.2 Testing
Suggested Word Count: 150-250 words
Outline the testing considerations for your plan next term. Will you include automated unit testing, user testing, performance testing, or security testing? Specify 2-3 tests that will serve as checkpoints for your milestones, ensuring they align with your acceptance criteria.

- The testing for our project will be fairly simple, yet it will ensure all functions and requirements are working properly. There will not be an automated unit test, as automating testing while the project is running would be a waste of CPU power and would not be needed. Instead, we will manually test the code, with a team member in charge of testing all project functions. Regarding user testing, there will be user testing, and we plan to find a random person who would like to use it at school. The user test will be a week long, and they will give a review. For performance testing, we will first do speed and storage tests on the backend and the front end then manual testing we will do. Regarding security testing, there will not be heavy testing, just authentication.


4.3 Foreseeable Risks
Suggested Word Count: 150-250 words
Create sections that address risks your project may encounter. In reality, many risks are only discovered as they arise. This exercise is about thinking ahead to anticipate and minimize them.

Detail potential risks and mitigation strategies for the following categories:

4.3.1 Technical Risks
Are there any skill gaps in your team that could affect the timeline? Is your chosen technology stack unproven or risky, and do you have a backup option?
- The only issue is that non of the members have made an application before so it is new to all of us, besides the lack of experence we are very confident that all the planned goals will be met.

4.3.2 Resource Risks
Do you have dependencies on acquiring licenses, materials, or funds? Are there concerns about losing team members or ensuring cross-functional coverage?
- No we luckily have to work for grade so we are "pushed" to always work together and will not have any loss of members, for our funds the only big financial impact is having a live server and app rights to ensure our product is secure, active, and protected. Due to our project being more on the digital side we can run everything off of a single device but for further implementation and expansion of the product we would need dedicated servers to run the code that allows the app services to stay available at all times.

4.3.3 External Dependencies
If your project depends on certain frameworks, how will you handle version updates or unexpected changes? Are there any integrations that rely on other teams or external parties?
