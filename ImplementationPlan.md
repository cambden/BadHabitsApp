Suggested Word Count: 150-250 words
Create sections that address risks your project may encounter. In reality, many risks are only discovered as they arise. This exercise is about thinking ahead to anticipate and minimize them.

Detail potential risks and mitigation strategies for the following categories:

4.3.1 Technical Risks
Are there any skill gaps in your team that could affect the timeline? Is your chosen technology stack unproven or risky, and do you have a backup option?

4.3.2 Resource Risks
Do you have dependencies on acquiring licenses, materials, or funds? Are there concerns about losing team members or ensuring cross-functional coverage?

4.3.3 External Dependencies
If your project depends on certain frameworks, how will you handle version updates or unexpected changes? Are there any integrations that rely on other teams or external parties?
