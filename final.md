## 1.0 Proposal
### 1.1 Concept Statement
As a registered user, I want to quit an addiction using TheHabitTracker so that I can live an improved and healthier life. 
When I feel like relapsing on an addiction I am trying to quit, I can click a panic button, which can call a trusted person I know, or receive an AI-generated Motivational text that keeps me from relapsing. 
As a registered user, I will have access to how long I have kept my good habits, so that I can use it as motivation to not fall back into bad habits. 
When I add a bad habit I want to quit, like quitting nicotine, TheHabitTracker will give me a questionnaire on what form of nicotine I've been using, how long, and why. 
Then, it will use AI queries to give me better alternatives to the products, and tips to help me quit depending on how long I have been using them and why I've been using that product. 
As a registered user, I want to have videos of other people who have maintained similar habits to me, so that I understand that I am not alone in this struggle. 
As a registered user, I want to have a reward of some kind when I've successfully maintained a good habit for a certain time limit so that there is more of a reward to maintaining good habits.

### 1.2 Context
Essientially we are looking to create a app that helps you quit bad habits and tracks your progress with a streak like duolingo. With this app we are ideally hoping to include
a cart system that will give you reccomended purchases that help you quit. For example, if your are trying to quit Zyns nicotine then the app can reccomend you mints or gum
to buy. <br>
We want to have a frontend that is done using: HTML, REACT, and JSX<br>
We want to have a backend that is done using: Python, and an API such as FastAPI<br>
Most of the challenge with creating this app should mainly come from the Sprint where we do our Cart and the Sprint where we do the streak system.

### 1.3 Required Capabilities
For our required capabilities we are looking for our app to include (ranked top to bottom from realisim): <br>
1. Motivational Quote Notifications<br>
2. Social Support System<br>
3. Streak System<br>
4. Shopping Cart<br>
5. Integration with Other Apps<br>

### 1.4 Expected Outcome of Implementation
The expected outcome of the implementation for our app is, to have an app that can discretely or openly bring together a group of people with similar 
habbits they are hoping to quit. Through this app they will be able to share a common goal of hoping to quit; With the Social Support System we are hoping to implement,
people will be able to communicate on products or other things that were able to help them quit that the Cart might not be able to mention.
<br>
Overall, this app should be helping people quit and track their progress quitting while motivating and helping them along this journey.
