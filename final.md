## 1.0 Proposal
### 1.1 Concept Statement
As a registered user, I want to quit an addiction using TheHabitTracker so that I can live an improved and healthier life. 
When I feel like relapsing on an addiction I am trying to quit, I can click a panic button, which can call a trusted person I know, or receive an AI-generated Motivational text that keeps me from relapsing. 
As a registered user, I will have access to how long I have kept my good habits, so that I can use it as motivation to not fall back into bad habits. 
When I add a bad habit I want to quit, like quitting nicotine, TheHabitTracker will give me a questionnaire on what form of nicotine I've been using, how long, and why. 
Then, it will use AI queries to give me better alternatives to the products, and tips to help me quit depending on how long I have been using them and why I've been using that product. 
As a registered user, I want to have videos of other people who have maintained similar habits to me, so that I understand that I am not alone in this struggle. 
As a registered user, I want to have a reward of some kind when I've successfully maintained a good habit for a certain time limit so that there is more of a reward to maintaining good habits.
