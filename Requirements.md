<u>2.0 Requirements and User Stories<u>

2.1 Required Functionality
    This app will require docker, kubernetes, tsx, REACT, python, and a bunch of html/mobile programming. Our app will be designed for the user to type in a subject they want to track and the app will send reccomendations on how to quit with

Suggested Word Count: 150-200 words
Develop a comprehensive list that catalogs all of the functionalities needed to successfully develop the project. This section will serve as a critical component of the project’s scope, much like a contract with a client, outlining exactly what features the project will implement and which ones will be planned in the future. Ensure that the list encompasses your entire project. For example, include any front-end, back-end, or hardware components if required.

Create a list of 5-10 functionalities and assign a category to each one based on the following:
Must Have: These are the features mandatory to meet the project needs.
Should Have: These are the features that will add significant value to the project but are not vital.
Could Have: Additional features that elevate the project to a professional level but have little to no impact if left out.
Will Not Have: Features you have considered but are not a priority at this time.

2.2 User Stories
Suggested Word Count: 200-300 words
Translate the required functionality into user stories that capture the end-user’s perspective. These stories should be concise, user-centered descriptions of the functionality, formatted in a way that can be easily validated and tested.

Create a list of 10-12 user stories using the following guidelines:
Use a template for story structure:
As a [user role], I want|need|have to [desired action] so that [reason or benefit].
When [situation], I want|need|have to [motivation] so that [outcome].

Attempt to break down user stories related to your "Must Have" required functionality as much as possible. If a functionality is broad, you can break it down into epics, but try to keep the number of epics to a minimum.

Each story should include clear and measurable acceptance criteria that define when the story is complete. While the focus should be on the user’s needs, consider including any critical technical details that might affect implementation.

2.3 User Personas
Suggested Word Count: 150-200 words
Provide 2-3 user personas or roles using the following format:

Name and photo.
Demographic information: age, education, occupation, short background.
Psychographic information: goals or needs (your project fulfills), frustrations (your project addresses).
2.4 Non-functional Requirements
Suggested Word Count: 150-250 words
List the non-functional requirements that will guide the project’s overall performance, security, and user experience. These requirements are essential to ensure that the project meets standards of quality, reliability, and sustainability. Create a section for each of the following relating to your project:

2.4.1 Security
    We plan to inplement a security system with multiple factors like authentification to ensure only the allowed users are allowed to see the what the habits the user has entered the progress made and other users who are on the contact/authorized personel list to edit or view data. Some methods of security we plan to use includes two factor authentification for every login, as well as a password protected section to view very personal information. For GDPR and HIPAA, HIPAA wont apply due to the lack of medical information being used within the application and it all being purely interactable, but GDPR will play into effect for our oversea users as we will only store data provided to us and this data will be stored and only accessible for the users and noone else ensuring limited access to data and an increase to overall privacy.

2.4.2 Performance
    We want to have the application work almost autonomously where it can be given information do research through our databases and then reply to the user with the information needed to help with any habit the person wants to break or make. We plan to first ensure the response capabilities are met like being able to hold a conversation with the user and to respond with reliable information and sourced data. We want this to be done in a timely manner so the user does not have to backtrack on their habits and possibly do something they do not want to. For the data storing section of our application we want the interface to ask the user to enter their habits, what they plan to improve or get rid of and also what plans they have for them which after this interaction is completed we should instantly return information to the user about what they said they wanted to do. Once this step is completed we will work on the interaction with our AI service agent to help focus in on the goals the user has and what plans to follow to achieve their goals.

2.4.3 Availability
    The app will be available all hours of the day; The only hours that the app will be down for will be for updates which will go out when their is the least amount of activity.    

2.4.4 Reliability
    The plan for reliability is the appication should be running perfectly at all times and no real fatal error should occur, This is purely input based information and the only errors would be made by the user inputing the incorrect information or choosing a new plan to change their habits that wasnt provided by the application. The backup protocols will go into effect in a timely matter within a certain period which will ensure 

2.4.5 Ethics and Sustainability
    There will be no bias in any of the algorithms considering this app is strictly to help people. User consent will not be required since it is completely optional for the user to submit their infor for help or not. There should be no data really needing to be kept, this app should be sufficient just via user input.
