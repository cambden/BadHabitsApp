<u>2.0 Requirements and User Stories<u>

2.1 Required Functionality
Suggested Word Count: 150-200 words
Develop a comprehensive list that catalogs all of the functionalities needed to successfully develop the project. This section will serve as a critical component of the project’s scope, much like a contract with a client, outlining exactly what features the project will implement and which ones will be planned in the future. Ensure that the list encompasses your entire project. For example, include any front-end, back-end, or hardware components if required.

Create a list of 5-10 functionalities and assign a category to each one based on the following:
Must Have: These are the features mandatory to meet the project needs.
Should Have: These are the features that will add significant value to the project but are not vital.
Could Have: Additional features that elevate the project to a professional level but have little to no impact if left out.
Will Not Have: Features you have considered but are not a priority at this time.

2.2 User Stories
Suggested Word Count: 200-300 words
Translate the required functionality into user stories that capture the end-user’s perspective. These stories should be concise, user-centered descriptions of the functionality, formatted in a way that can be easily validated and tested.

Create a list of 10-12 user stories using the following guidelines:
Use a template for story structure:
As a [user role], I want|need|have to [desired action] so that [reason or benefit].
When [situation], I want|need|have to [motivation] so that [outcome].

Attempt to break down user stories related to your "Must Have" required functionality as much as possible. If a functionality is broad, you can break it down into epics, but try to keep the number of epics to a minimum.

Each story should include clear and measurable acceptance criteria that define when the story is complete. While the focus should be on the user’s needs, consider including any critical technical details that might affect implementation.

2.3 User Personas
Suggested Word Count: 150-200 words
Provide 2-3 user personas or roles using the following format:

Name and photo.
Demographic information: age, education, occupation, short background.
Psychographic information: goals or needs (your project fulfills), frustrations (your project addresses).
2.4 Non-functional Requirements
Suggested Word Count: 150-250 words
List the non-functional requirements that will guide the project’s overall performance, security, and user experience. These requirements are essential to ensure that the project meets standards of quality, reliability, and sustainability. Create a section for each of the following relating to your project:

2.4.1 Security
Define the security measures needed to protect data, such as encryption, secure authentication, and compliance with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.

2.4.2 Performance
Specify any performance benchmarks, such as expected response times.

2.4.3 Availability
Outline the expected availability metrics, including uptime requirements, and redundancy plans.

2.4.4 Reliability
Error handling will be done through 'try' and 'catch' ensuring proper handling is done. There should be no need for backup andything other than servers.

2.4.5 Ethics and Sustainability
There will be no bias in any of the algorithms we use; This app will be strictly dedicated to help people. Data will be kept private at all times since there is no need, we will only ask for feedback on the app itself.
