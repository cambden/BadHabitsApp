<u>3.0 Technical Specifications and Design</u>

3.1 Design

Our main core design prinicple will be:
<br>
  Balance: Using balance we will be focusing on making the app visually apealing with everything perfectly spaced out and align. This will give the user mushc more enjoyment
           the app rather than it just being an 'eye-sore'. With balance we also allow the user to navigate much easier allowing them to switch between their differnt 'tabs' and 
           'redirection' screens. With balance we can bring in the other subcategories such as allignment and proportion. These will mainly be done in the css style and if                  anything is directly needed only once for that single line then it will be 'in-line' styling
           
  - This core principle will as mentioned before allow the user to naigate the app much easier. This leads to a greater rating and more time spent on the app which can then lead     to sponors and so on. If sponsors are able to be obtained this will give us the oppurtunity to make drastic changes to the app in security enhancements and better UI             upgrades.

Be sure to address how these decisions help meet your non-functional requirements, such as security, reliability, or performance. Include details like whether your project is a single-page application, desktop app, or mobile app, and explain the rationale for that choice.

Specify if a database is used, and if so, what type. If your project includes an API, describe the type (e.g., REST) and why it was selected. Also, discuss the frameworks you chose and the reasons behind these decisions. This section should be clear and concise, aimed at a low-technical audience to help them grasp your overall approach.

Include a workflow diagram to visually summarize the design in a way that is accessible to a low-technical audience.

3.2 Architecture Approach
Suggested Word Count: 300-500 words
This section should offer a detailed breakdown of the technical components in your project. Begin with a comprehensive component diagram that shows all the key components and their relationships. This diagram should be more detailed than the one in the Design section.

Following the diagram, provide an in-depth explanation of each component in individual sections. Include details such as API endpoint names and their documentation (preferably in OpenAPI format), database schemas, and any necessary sequence or workflow diagrams for each component. If you are using a specific framework or service, explain how it is implemented and what is required for it to function. Additionally, if your project follows an architectural pattern, such as event-driven or microservice architecture, provide a thorough explanation of how it is applied and integrated into the project.

3.3 Software Solution
Suggested Word Count: 100-150 words - mostly images
Using a diagramming tool (either one reviewed in class or one of your choice), create a series of wireframes or prototypes that illustrate the flow of your project. Include detailed annotations within the images or use numbered references, with corresponding explanations provided in the document.

For example, if there is an "add" button on a webpage, describe what the "add" action does and which component or requirement it is connected to. If your project requires an overall workflow explanation, start with a high-level diagram that outlines the approach before diving into the specifics.
